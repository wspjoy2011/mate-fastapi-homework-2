### Tip: Using `get_db` for Dependency Injection in FastAPI

The `get_db` function is a generator that provides a SQLAlchemy session for interacting with the database. This function
is particularly useful in FastAPI as it can be injected into route handlers using the `Depends` mechanism. Here’s how
you can use it effectively:

```python
from fastapi import Depends, APIRouter
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session
from database import get_db  # Import the get_db generator

router = APIRouter()


@router.get("/example")
def example_route(db: Session = Depends(get_db)):
# Use the db session here to interact with the database
```

#### Key Points:

- The `Depends` function simplifies injecting dependencies like the database session into your route handlers.
- The `get_db` function ensures proper session handling: the session is created before the route logic executes and is
  closed automatically afterward.
- This approach promotes cleaner, more testable code by separating dependency setup from business logic.

You can use this pattern across your application for any routes that need database access.

### Services Overview

The project is configured with the following services in the `docker-compose.yml` file. These services collectively
support the development, testing, and deployment of the Movie Theater API:

#### **1. Database Service (`db`)**

- **Image**: `postgres:latest`
- **Purpose**: Acts as the primary database for the project, running a PostgreSQL instance.
- **Configuration**:
    - Loads initial SQL setup from `init.sql`.
    - Stores persistent data using a named Docker volume `postgres_theater_data`.
    - Exposes PostgreSQL on port `5432`.
- **Health Check**: Ensures the database is ready by using the `pg_isready` command.
- **Network**: Attached to `theater_network`.

#### **2. pgAdmin Service (`pgadmin`)**

- **Image**: `dpage/pgadmin4`
- **Purpose**: Provides a web-based interface for managing and monitoring the PostgreSQL database.
- **Configuration**:
    - Exposes pgAdmin on port `3333`.
    - Stores pgAdmin data in the `pgadmin_theater_data` volume.
- **Dependency**: Starts only after the `db` service is healthy.
- **Network**: Attached to `theater_network`.

#### **3. Backend Service (`web`)**

- **Build Context**: Builds the FastAPI application from the local directory (`.`).
- **Purpose**: Runs the FastAPI application, serving the Movie Theater API backend.
- **Configuration**:
    - Exposes the backend on port `8000`.
    - Uses the `run_web_server_dev.sh` script to start the development server.
    - Watches for file changes in the `src` directory using `WATCHFILES_FORCE_POLLING=true`.
    - Mounts the `src` directory to `/usr/src/fastapi` inside the container for live development.
- **Dependency**: Starts only after the `db` service is healthy.
- **Network**: Attached to `theater_network`.

#### **4. Database Migrator Service (`migrator`)**

- **Build Context**: Shares the same build context as the backend service.
- **Purpose**: Runs database migrations using Alembic to ensure the schema is up-to-date.
- **Configuration**:
    - Executes the `run_migration.sh` script to apply migrations.
    - Uses the `src` directory as the source for migration scripts.
- **Dependency**: Starts only after the `db` service is healthy.
- **Network**: Attached to `theater_network`.

### Volumes

- **`postgres_theater_data`**:
    - Stores persistent PostgreSQL data.
- **`pgadmin_theater_data`**:
    - Stores persistent data for pgAdmin.

### Task Description: Extending the Cinema Application

In this assignment, you are tasked with continuing the development of the cinema application. Your objective is to
implement two endpoints in the `schemas/movies.py` and `routes/movies.py` files. The rest of the application, including
database models and utility functions, has already been provided.

### Task 1: Implement Movies List Endpoint

Your task is to implement an endpoint in the `routes/movies.py` file that retrieves a **paginated list of movies** from
the database. The required response structure is detailed below.


#### Endpoint Details

- **HTTP Method**: `GET`
- **Path**: `/movies/`


#### Query Parameters

- **`page`** (integer):
    - Specifies the page number to retrieve.
    - **Default**: `1`
    - **Constraints**: Must be greater than or equal to `1`.

- **`per_page`** (integer):
    - Specifies the number of items to display per page.
    - **Default**: `10`
    - **Constraints**: Must be between `1` and `20` (inclusive).


#### Response Structure

The endpoint should return the following JSON response:

```json
{
  "movies": [
    {
      "id": 9936,
      "name": "Avatar new",
      "date": "2022-12-15",
      "score": 78.0,
      "overview": "Set more than a decade after the events of the first film..."
    }
  ],
  "prev_page": null,
  "next_page": "/theater/movies/?page=2&per_page=1",
  "total_pages": 9934,
  "total_items": 9934
}
```

#### Behavior

1. **Sorting**: Movies must be sorted in descending order by their `id`.
2. **Pagination**:
    - The `page` and `per_page` parameters control pagination.
    - The `prev_page` and `next_page` fields should provide links to the previous and next pages, respectively, or
      `null` if no such page exists.
3. **Empty Results**:
    - If no movies are found for the specified page, the endpoint should return a `404 Not Found` error with the
      message: `"No movies found."`

#### HTTP Responses

- **200 OK**: Successfully retrieved a paginated list of movies.
- **404 Not Found**: No movies found for the specified page.

This task requires you to implement both the endpoint logic in `routes/movies.py` and the response structure in
`schemas/movies.py`. Ensure that your implementation handles all edge cases, such as invalid query parameters or empty
results.

### Task 2: Implement Movie Creation Endpoint

Your task is to implement an endpoint in the `routes/movies.py` file that allows the creation of a new movie in the database. The required request and response structures are detailed below.


#### Endpoint Details

- **HTTP Method**: `POST`
- **Path**: `/movies/`


#### Request Body

The endpoint accepts a JSON object with the following fields:

```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "date": "date",
  "score": "float (0-100)",
  "overview": "string",
  "status": "string (Released | Post Production | In Production)",
  "budget": "float (>= 0)",
  "revenue": "float (>= 0)",
  "country": "string (ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 code)",
  "genres": ["string"],
  "actors": ["string"],
  "languages": ["string"]
}
```


#### Response Structure

The endpoint returns the created movie's details in the following format:

```json
{
  "id": "integer",
  "name": "string",
  "date": "date",
  "score": "float",
  "overview": "string",
  "status": "string",
  "budget": "float",
  "revenue": "float",
  "country": {
    "id": "integer",
    "code": "string",
    "name": "string or null"
  },
  "genres": [
    {
      "id": "integer",
      "name": "string"
    }
  ],
  "actors": [
    {
      "id": "integer",
      "name": "string"
    }
  ],
  "languages": [
    {
      "id": "integer",
      "name": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```


#### Behavior

1. **Validation**:
   - The `name` must not exceed 255 characters.
   - The `date` must not be more than one year in the future.
   - The `score` must be between 0 and 100.
   - The `budget` and `revenue` must be non-negative.

2. **Entity Linking**:
   - The endpoint automatically links or creates related entities (country, genres, actors, languages) if they do not already exist in the database.

3. **Duplicate Check**:
   - If a movie with the same `name` and `date` already exists, the endpoint returns a `409 Conflict` error with an appropriate message.
   - Message: "A movie with the name '{name}' and release date '{date}' already exists."
   
4. **Error Handling**:
   - Returns a `400 Bad Request` if the input data is invalid.


#### HTTP Responses

- **201 Created**: The movie was successfully created, and its details are returned in the response.
- **400 Bad Request**: The input data is invalid (e.g., missing required fields, invalid values).
- **409 Conflict**: A movie with the same `name` and `date` already exists.


#### Example Requests

1. **Request**:

   - The `movie_id` must correspond to an existing movie in the database.

2. **Error Handling**:
   - If the movie with the given `movie_id` does not exist, the endpoint must return a `404 Not Found` error with the message: `"Movie with the given ID was not found."`

3. **Successful Deletion**:
   - The movie is removed from the database, and the endpoint returns a `204 No Content` status.


#### Example Requests

1. **Request**:
   ```http
   DELETE /movies/1/
   ```

   **Response**:
   - **Status Code**: `204 No Content`

2. **Request**:
   ```http
   DELETE /movies/999/
   ```

   **Response**:
   ```json
   {
     "detail": "Movie with the given ID was not found."
   }
   ```

### Task 5: Implement Movie Update Endpoint

Your task is to implement an endpoint in the `routes/movies.py` file that updates the details of a specific movie by its unique ID. The details for this endpoint are provided below.


#### Endpoint Details

- **HTTP Method**: `PATCH`
- **Path**: `/movies/{movie_id}/`


#### Path Parameters

- **`movie_id`** (integer):  
  The unique identifier of the movie to update.


#### Request Body

The endpoint accepts a JSON object with the following optional fields. Any fields not provided will remain unchanged in the database:

```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "date": "date",
  "score": "float (0-100)",
  "overview": "string",
  "status": "string (Released | Post Production | In Production)",
  "budget": "float (>= 0)",
  "revenue": "float (>= 0)"
}
```


#### Response Structure

The endpoint returns a response indicating the result of the update operation:


#### HTTP Responses

- **200 OK**: Successfully updated the movie.
  ```json
  {
    "detail": "Movie updated successfully."
  }
  ```

- **404 Not Found**: The movie with the specified ID does not exist.
  ```json
  {
    "detail": "Movie with the given ID was not found."
  }
  ```

- **400 Bad Request**: The input data is invalid (e.g., violates constraints).
  ```json
  {
    "detail": "Invalid input data."
  }
  ```


#### Behavior

1. **Validation**:
   - Only the provided fields in the request body are updated.
   - The `score` must be between 0 and 100.
   - The `budget` and `revenue` must be non-negative.

2. **Entity Retrieval**:
   - The endpoint checks if a movie with the given `movie_id` exists. If not, it returns a `404 Not Found` error.

3. **Partial Update**:
   - Updates only the fields provided in the request body, leaving all other fields unchanged.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If invalid input data is provided, the endpoint returns a `400 Bad Request` error.


#### Example Requests

1. **Request**:
   ```http
   PATCH /movies/1/
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "name": "Updated Movie Name",
     "score": 95.0
   }
   ```

   **Response**:
   ```json
   {
     "detail": "Movie updated successfully."
   }
   ```

2. **Request**:
   ```http
   PATCH /movies/999/
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "name": "Nonexistent Movie"
   }
   ```

   **Response**:
   ```json
   {
     "detail": "Movie with the given ID was not found."
   }
   ```

3. **Request**:
   ```http
   PATCH /movies/1/
   Content-Type: application/json

   {
     "score": 150.0
   }
   ```

   **Response**:
   ```json
   {
     "detail": "Invalid input data."
   }
   ```

### Tips and Guidance

If you’re unsure about the expected behavior or need clarification, **refer to the provided test suite**. Running the tests will:
- Show the expected logic and flow for each endpoint.
- Help you identify edge cases and handle errors correctly.
- Ensure your implementation aligns with the project's requirements.

To run the tests, use the following command in the project root directory:
```bash
pytest
```

The test results will indicate any discrepancies between your implementation and the expected behavior, providing clear guidance on how to fix them.
